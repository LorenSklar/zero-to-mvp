    “I’m a high school student, and I launched a <span class="highlight-text">Stripe-powered MVP with paying users</span> in just six weeks that helps teens find fashion that feels like it's made for them.” — Tochi U.

  <blockquote>
    “I started with <span class="highlight-text">zero coding knowledge</span> and built a real company. I didn’t think it was possible in that short time, but now I have a small business that’s <span class="highlight-text">already making money</span>.” — Michael Q.

  <blockquote>
    “Before <strong>Be Your Own CTO Bootcamp</strong>, I didn’t even know what an MVP was. Now I’m building a product that helps families save money on prosthetics <span class="highlight-text">using real user data</span> to make decisions.” — Jose P.

  <p style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 1em; color: gray;">
    I coached these founders before launching <strong>Be Your Own CTO Bootcamp</strong>. Each one built and launched their MVP with my support proving that real products don’t require a CS degree or a big budget.

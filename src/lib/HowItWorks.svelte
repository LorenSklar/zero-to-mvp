  <h1 class="section-title">How It Works</h1>
  <p>For 6 weeks, you build your MVP step by step with expert coaching and just enough help from AI tools to get the job done.</p>

  <h5>Week 1: </h5><h5>State the Problem</h5>
  <p style="margin-top: 0">Clarify your idea, your user, and what success looks like.</p>

  <h5>Week 2: </h5><h5>Plan Your MVP</h5>
  <p style="margin-top: 0">This is the crucial step that everyone skips. AI can't do it for you. Dev shops charge a fortune for it. We help you break your idea into simple, buildable parts you can code yourself.</p>

  <h5>Week 3: </h5><h5>Learn to Read Code</h5>
  <p style="margin-top: 0">You learn just enough JavaScript and HTML/CSS to understand your MVP and fix it without help.</p>

  <h5>Week 4: </h5><h5>Build Your MVP</h5>
  <p style="margin-top: 0">Guided by your coach with an assist from AI coding tools, you assemble your MVP piece by piece.</p>

  <h5>Week 5: </h5><h5>Launch and Learn</h5>
  <p style="margin-top: 0">Ship your product. Now you're attracting real users. Find out fast what works and what doesn’t.</p>

  <h5>Week 6: </h5><h5>Pivot or Scale</h5>
  <p style="margin-top: 0">With real data, you are in control. Iterate fast. Pivot hard. Or raise with real traction. You're not just dreaming. You're doing.</p>

  <h5>After Week 6: </h5>
  <p style="margin-top: 0">You leave with a working MVP and the skills to improve it, no dev team or CTO required.”.</p>
